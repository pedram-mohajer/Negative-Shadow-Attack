# üï≥Ô∏è Living in the Shadows: Practical Attack on Autonomous Vehicle Black-Box Lane Detection Systems

This repository implements the **Negative Shadow (NS) attack**‚Äîa stealthy, non-invasive adversarial method that targets **Automated Lane Centering (ALC)** systems in Level 2 autonomous vehicles. By casting sunlight through physical occluders (e.g., canopies or fences), the attack produces bright, lane-like patterns that exploit intensity bias in LD preprocessing. These patterns cause the ALC system to misinterpret them as valid lane markings, leading to off-path deviations or unsafe maneuvers‚Äîwithout modifying the road or vehicle.

## üîß Installation (Docker Recommended)

To ensure reproducibility and GPU support, we strongly recommend running in a Docker environment.

### 1. Install Docker & Compose

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
sudo service docker start
```

### 2. Enable NVIDIA Runtime

Update `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    },
    "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
```

Then restart Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 3. Build and Run the Container

```bash
docker compose build --build-arg UID="$(id -u)" dev
docker compose run --rm dev
```

## üöÄ Project Overview

This pipeline simulates and evaluates the Negative Shadow attack under two modes:

- **Random Mode**: generate `n` random shadows and test three LD models.
- **Search Mode**: apply a Genetic Algorithm to find adversarial NS parameters.

### Supported Lane Detectors:
- **TwinLiteNet** (lightweight, feature-based)
- **HybridNets** (multi-task perception network)
- **CLRerNet** (confidence-regularized)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Pipeline

### Default Entry: `main.py`

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, `main.py` runs search-based optimization. To run random sampling instead:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(n_samples=1000, search_based=False)
```

### What It Does
- Generates NS images in BEV (`NS_Images_BEV/`)
- Warps them to driver-view (`NS_Images_Driver/`)
- Evaluates lane overlap using all three detectors
- Stores metadata in `shadow_lengths.csv`
- Outputs visual results and detection flags to `results/`

## üß¨ Genetic Optimization (Search Mode)

`optimizer.py` runs a Genetic Algorithm to evolve high-impact shadow parameters.

Fitness is based on:
- **Detector Fooling**: overlap between NS region and predicted lanes
- **Parameter Tuning**: Encourages shadows with width \(W\), length \(L\), distance \(D\), and angle \(\beta\) values that align with ranges empirically shown to confuse LD models.

Top candidates are retained and mutated over generations to find stealthy yet effective shadows.


## üß† Search-Based Negative Shadow Generation via Genetic Algorithm (Step-by-Step)


The search-based Negative Shadow (NS) attack uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve adversarial shadow patterns that fool lane detection (LD) models. Each candidate shadow is parameterized by geometric and photometric features and evaluated over multiple generations to maximize its effectiveness. Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Inputs**: The algorithm takes:
   - `P`: population size
   - `G`: number of generations
   - `I_BEV`: bird‚Äôs-eye-view image
   - `H_BEV‚ÜíDRV`: homography to map BEV to driver-view
   - `M_px`: meters-per-pixel scaling factor

2. **LD Models**: The attack targets three models:
   - TwinLiteNet
   - HybridNets
   - CLRerNet

3. **Parameter Bounds**: Each shadow is defined by:
   - Width `W ‚àà [0.1, 3.6]` meters
   - Length `L ‚àà [1, 40]` meters
   - Lateral distance `D ‚àà [0.1, 3.5]` meters
   - Angle `Œ≤ ‚àà [0¬∞, 90¬∞]`

4. **Candidate Sampling**: For each individual in the population, the algorithm randomly samples pixel values:
   - `y1`: initial vertical position
   - `h`: height
   - `y2 = y1 + h`
   - `y3`: for slope
   - `x`: lateral placement

5. **Polygon Formation**: These values define a convex quadrilateral `P_BEV`. Convexity is enforced.

6. **Photometric Modification**:
   - Convert `I_BEV` to LAB space ‚Üí `(L*, a*, b*)`
   - Brighten `L*` within the polygon by `Œî_L* = 20`
   - Convert back to RGB to get modified `I_BEV'`

7. **Warping to Driver View**:
   - Apply `H_BEV‚ÜíDRV` to generate `I_DRV` (driver-perspective image)

8. **Geometry Extraction**:
   - `L_i`: physical length of the shadow
   - `W_i`: width in meters
   - `D_i`: lateral offset from a reference line
   - `Œ≤_i`: angle from vertical axis

9. **Model Evaluation**:
   - For each LD model:
     - Predict line mask `M_LD_k`
     - Compute overlap ratio:
       ```
       Œ≥_k = |P_DRV ‚à© M_LD_k| / |P_DRV|
       ```
     - Assign detection flag:
       ```
       Œ¥_k = 1 if Œ≥_k > œÑ, else 0
       ```

10. **Fitness Calculation**:
    - Each candidate is scored as:
      ```
      f_i = 0.5 * avg(Œ≥_1, Œ≥_2, Œ≥_3) + 0.5 * avg(Œ¥_1, Œ¥_2, Œ¥_3)
      ```
    - This balances how strongly and consistently the NS fools detectors.

11. **Selection & Evolution**:
    - Retain the top 50% by fitness
    - Use crossover and mutation to regenerate the rest
    - Repeat for `G` generations

12. **Output**:
    - Optimized NS patterns
    - Corresponding driver-view images
    - Detection logs and overlap scores
    - `shadow_lengths.csv` with geometry metadata
