# 🕳️ Negative Shadow Attack: Adversarial Bright Patterns for Lane Detection Deception

This repository implements the **Negative Shadow (NS) attack**—a stealthy and practical adversarial technique that deceives state-of-the-art lane detection (LD) systems using bright, lane-like patterns. These patterns, generated by casting sunlight through occluders, exploit brightness-based vulnerabilities in LD pipelines, causing misdetection without altering road infrastructure.

## 🔧 Installation (Docker Recommended)

To ensure reproducibility and GPU support, we strongly recommend running in a Docker environment.

### 1. Install Docker & Compose

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
sudo service docker start
```

### 2. Enable NVIDIA Runtime

Update `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    },
    "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
```

Then restart Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 3. Build and Run the Container

```bash
docker compose build --build-arg UID="$(id -u)" dev
docker compose run --rm dev
```

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This pipeline simulates and evaluates the Negative Shadow attack under two modes:

- **Random Mode**: generate `n` random shadows and test three LD models.
- **Search Mode**: apply a Genetic Algorithm to find adversarial NS parameters.

### Supported Lane Detectors:
- **TwinLiteNet** (lightweight, feature-based)
- **HybridNets** (multi-task perception network)
- **CLRerNet** (confidence-regularized)

---

## ▶️ Running the Pipeline

### Default Entry: `main.py`

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, `main.py` runs search-based optimization. To run random sampling instead:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(n_samples=1000, search_based=False)
```

### What It Does
- Generates NS images in BEV (`NS_Images_BEV/`)
- Warps them to driver-view (`NS_Images_Driver/`)
- Evaluates lane overlap using all three detectors
- Stores metadata in `shadow_lengths.csv`
- Outputs visual results and detection flags to `results/`

## 🧬 Genetic Optimization (Search Mode)

`optimizer.py` runs a Genetic Algorithm to evolve high-impact shadow parameters.

Fitness is based on:
- **Detector Fooling**: overlap between NS region and predicted lanes
- **Parameter Tuning**: Encourages shadows with width \(W\), length \(L\), distance \(D\), and angle \(\beta\) values that align with ranges empirically shown to confuse LD models.

Top candidates are retained and mutated over generations to find stealthy yet effective shadows.


## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This research is intended solely for academic and ethical security analysis. All experiments were run in simulation or controlled conditions. The NS attack demonstrates vulnerabilities in lane detection pipelines and emphasizes the need for robust defenses in AV perception systems.
