    """
    Composite fitness function for evaluating the quality of a shadow polygon.
    Higher score = better attack (maximize this).

    Parameters
    ----------
    overlap1 : float
        Overlap ratio from TwinLiteNet (0 to 1)
    overlap2 : float
        Overlap ratio from HybridNet (0 to 1)
    overlap3 : float
        Overlap ratio from CLRerNet (0 to 1)
    length_m : float
        Length of the shadow in meters
    width_cm : float
        Width of the shadow in centimeters
    distance_cm : float
        Distance from real lane in centimeters
    angle_deg : float
        Angle of the shadow in degrees

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Fitness score (higher is better for maximization-based search)
